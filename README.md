# OT-based-Heterogeneous-Multi-Modal-Fusion-Embedding-for-AD-analysis-

Original code for OT from https://github.com/Qinkaiyu/RIMA

The currenct code is a modified version of the above to encompass heterogenous MultiModal AD data

Current code takes MRI and PET data from ADNI
Currently working on a fix for jax dependency for faster training

This project analyzes ADNI's MRI and PET data using an Optimal Transport (OT)-based heterogeneous multimodal fusion approach, currently undergoing optimization with JAX to improve training performance.
