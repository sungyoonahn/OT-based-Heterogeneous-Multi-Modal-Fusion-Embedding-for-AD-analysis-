# OT-based-Heterogeneous-Multi-Modal-Fusion-Embedding-for-AD-analysis

This repository provides an Optimal Transport (OT) based framework for heterogeneous multi-modal fusion embedding, specifically designed for **Alzheimer's Disease (AD) analysis**. 

This project analyzes ADNI's MRI and PET data using an Optimal Transport (OT)-based heterogeneous multimodal fusion approach, currently undergoing optimization with JAX to improve training performance.

## Key Features
* **Heterogeneous Multi-modal Fusion**: Specialized in integrating diverse data sources for AD diagnostic analysis.
* **OT-based Embedding**: Leverages Optimal Transport to align and fuse different feature distributions effectively.
* **ADNI Data Support**: Pre-configured to process and analyze **MRI** and **PET** imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
* **Optimization in Progress**: Currently transitioning to **JAX** dependencies to achieve significantly faster training speeds and improved computational efficiency.

## Data Modalities
* **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: Structural brain data.
* **PET (Positron Emission Tomography)**: Functional/metabolic brain data.
* *Dataset source: ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)*
* The dataset was extracted from *ADNI* using *ADNIMERGE_26Nov2025*. Which was the latest version.

OT 기반 이기종 멀티모달 임베딩 정렬 코드는 Optimal Transport 구현을 기반으로 Alzheimer’s Disease(AD) 영역의 이기종 멀티모달 데이터를 포괄하도록 수정했으며, 현재 ADNI의 MRI·PET를 입력으로 JAX 의존성 최적화를 통해 학습 속도 향상을 추진중임
