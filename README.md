# OT-based Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Fusion Embedding for AD Analysis

This repository implements an Optimal Transport (OT) based framework for fusing heterogeneous multi-modal data, specifically tailored for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) analysis.

## 📌 Key Features
- **Heterogeneous Fusion:** Specialized for multi-modal AD data integration.
- **Multi-Modal Support:** Currently supports MRI and PET data from the **ADNI** dataset.
- **Optimized Performance:** (Ongoing) Migrating to JAX for significantly faster training speeds.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Status
- **Language:** Python
- **Core Library:** Based on [RIMA](https://github.com/Qinkaiyu/RIMA)
- **Status:** (Planned) Migration to JAX for optimized training performance.

## 📂 Dataset
- **ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative):** Primarily utilizes MRI and PET imaging data.
